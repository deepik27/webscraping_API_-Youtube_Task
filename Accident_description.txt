Python and TensorFlow: Text Classification -- Part 3

General Description:
In this series of videos, we will be using the TensorFlow Python module to construct a neural network that distinguishes whether a given movie review is either positive or negative. 

We will be obtaining movie reviews from IMDB (Internet Movie Database) and using that as our dataset. The intent of these videos is to showcase the use of TensorFlow as well as showing a simple example of how to construct and use a simple neural network.
